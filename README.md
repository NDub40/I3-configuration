My brand new updatedd configuration.
If you're using it please read carerfully as it's set-up for my workflow and for the tools i use daily example my Rofi and dmenu section could get slightly conmfusing.
I use virt-manager to only virtualize windows because I root and flash android operatong systems wine just doesn't cut it I need an almost real Windows instance. 
This configuration has changed drastically throughout the last the four years. The original version is actually in my main branch of this repositiory.
