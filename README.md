My brand new updatedd configuration.
If you're using it please read carerfully as it's set-up for my workflow (vim motions) and for the tools I use daily, example: my Rofi and dmenu section could get slightly confusing.
I use virt-manager to only virtualize windows because I root and flash android operatong systems, WINE just doesn't cut it. I need an almost real Windows instance. 
This configuration has changed drastically throughout the last the four years. The original version is actually in my main branch of this repositiory.
